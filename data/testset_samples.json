The solvent was evaporated to dryness to give to batches: one pure EN02972-52-02 (12 g, 28.5 mmol, 91 %), one less pure EN02972-52-03 (0.8 g, 1.903 mmol, 6.06 %).  The foam EN02972-52-02 (12 g, 28.5 mmol, 91 %) was dissolved in hot EtOH (12mL). Crystallisation occurred. The resulting crystalline solid was collected by filtration and dried to a constant weight to afford EN02972-52-04 (8.7 g, 19.04 mmol, 60.6 %) as a white crystalline solid. Its filtrate was combined with EN02972-52-03 (0.8 g, 1.903 mmol, 6.06 %) and vacced down. The solid was taken up into EtOH, collected by filtration to give a second crop as a white solid EN02972-52-05 (1.88 g, 4.47 mmol, 14.24 %).  "}

The reaction was incomplete so further cesium carbonate (81 mg, 0.25 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (19.27 mg, 0.03 mmol) and diacetoxyzinc (30.6 mg, 0.17 mmol) were added and the mixture was degassed. Further Palladium(II) acetate (3.74 mg, 0.02 mmol) was added, and the mixture was degassed and stirred at 130 °C for 1 hour in the CEM microwave, then allowed to cool to amibient temperature. TLC (10% MeOH in DCM + 1% cNH3 (aq)) suggests bromo SM has been consumed but no evidence of desired product having been formed. UPLC shows only oxidised xantphos.  Reaction stopped  "}

LCMS of the crude reaction mixture shows the required product to be the major product together with an isomer of the same mass (Rt= 1.91), the ratio of the desired product to this isomeric product being circa 5:1. LCMS also shows that a small amount of the 2-aminooxazole ester starting material remains (Rt= 0.99 min) and so the reaction with this particular substrate may benefit from slightly longer reaction times, maybe 90 mins. A small amount of the coupled and decarboxylated product was also present (Rt= 1.68 min).  Saturated ammonium chloride (15 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was transfrred to a separating funnel. Ethyl acetate (80 mL) was then added and the organic layer was separated (keeping the interfacial material with the organic layer). The aqueous layer was washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 80 mL portions). (Note: During this extraction, a solid, presumably the required product was seen to crash out in the organic layer. If this reaction is to be repeated a work-up free approach is recommended where the crude reaction mixture is dry-loaded directly onto silica for chromatographic purification). The solvent was removed from the combined organics under reduced pressure. The crude product was loaded onto a pre- wetted silica column using the minimum DCM and methanol.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 100% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 744 mg of impure product.  The crude residue was triturated with Et2O to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (415 mg, 44.3 %) as a beige solid.    Conclusion: The desired product was isolated in moderate yield and high purity (95% based on strength NMR). The moderate yield may be improved under a longer reaction time, it is also probable that purification difficulties were also detrimental to the yield of this reaction.  , please calculate the yield of products of reaction.", "RESPONSE": "44.34000015258789"}

The crude residue was triturated with Et2O to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (415 mg, 44.3 %) as a beige solid.    Conclusion: The desired product was isolated in moderate yield and high purity (95% based on strength NMR). The moderate yield may be improved under a longer reaction time, it is also probable that purification difficulties were also detrimental to the yield of this reaction.  "}

Purification by chromatography on silica using heptane:ethyl acetate as eluent, on alumina with heptane:ethyl acetate and via reverse phase on C18 silica failed. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 3% Methanolic ammonia (7 M) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (534 mg, 49.9 %) as a pale yellow solid.  Althought the LCMS looks good for the fractions combined for this sample, the proton NMR shows significant impurities to be present.  Conclusion: Sufficient material isolated for hydrolysis/decarboxylation study.  "}

The reaction mixture was heated to 160°C for a further 3 h due to incomplete conversion.  DCM (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2 g). The solvent was then removed from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was then added tom a dry-load tube prior to chromatography.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 2.5% methanolic ammonia (7 M) in DCM. The desired product (4-substitution) was isolated as a mixture with the 2-substituted product. The ratio of the 2-isomer to the 4-isomer is 2.4:1 for the mxture with no other fractions containing either isomer.  Conclusion: The apparent higher selectivity for the 4-isomer is due to the overlap of the 2,4-dichloropyridine starting material with this isomer. Therefore this reaction actually forms the 2-isomer selectively and is not a very active catalyst for this transformation.  "}

The atmosphere was exchanged to nitrogen through consecutive vacuum- nitrogen purge cycles after which the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 16 h. Still some starting material left according to HPLC and LCMS (IPC 1), so another 25 mg of Pd(OAc)2 and 116 mg of BINAP was added, and heating continued. After another 4 h, no further progress was detected (IPC 2), so the mixture was allowed to cool to r.t.  Dichloromethane (200 mL) was added and pH was adjusted to 2 by addition of 2M HCl (aq) (80 mL was added, but made too acidic). The phases were separated and the aq phase was made basic by addition of 1M NaOH (aq) (ca 70 mL). The aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and re-extracted with another portion of dichloromethane (70 mL). Since the aq phase still contained some product, another portion of 1M NaOH (aq) (20 mL) was added and the aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL).

The atmosphere was exchanged to nitrogen through consecutive vacuum- nitrogen purge cycles after which the mixture was heated at 120 °C for 18 h. Still some starting material left according to HPLC and LCMS (IPC 1), so another 25 mg of Pd(OAc)2 and 116 mg of BINAP was added, and heating continued. After another 3 h, approx. 2% starting material remained according to LCMS (IPC 2), so the mixture was allowed to cool to r.t. Dichloromethane (200 mL) was added and pH was adjusted to 2 by addition of 2M HCl (aq) (140 mL was added, but made too acidic). The phases were separated and the aq phase was made basic by addition of 1M NaOH (aq) (ca 200 mL). The aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and re-extracted with another portion of dichloromethane (70 mL). Since an oily residue containing product had precipitated upon addition of acid/ base, the aq phase together with 100 mL dichloromethane was added to the residue in an attempt to dissolve it. More 1M NaOH (aq) was added to assure basic pH and the layers were separated. The combined organic layers were evaporated and the residue was dried under vacuum o.n. EN04391-36-001 (12.2 g, 27.6 mmol, 109 %) was obtained as a brown solid.  To the solid was added isopropanol (48 mL, 4 mL/g crude prod) and the thick suspension was heated at 95 °C. After 30 min, the slurry was allowed to cool to r.t and left stirring over night. The still thick slurry was cooled on an ice bath at 0-5 °C for 1 h before it was filtered. The solid was washed with 4x15 mL of cold isopropanol and dried at 40 °C under vacuum o.n, yielding EN04391-36-002 (2.05 g, 4.63 mmol, 18.38 %) as a pale yellow solid  The mother liquor that still contained product was concentrated. An orange- brown foam was obtained. Toluene was added and evaporated and the residue (8 g) was dissolved in MeCN (13.5 mL) and purified by chromatography (200 g SiO2 in a filter funnel, elutent: EtOAc (750 mL) followed by MeCN (1 L) and MeCN:MeOH 9:1 (1 L)).

Second setup fractions combined, lyophllized, purified by ISCO column (0 - 20% MeOH-CH2Cl2 \\+ 0.05% TEA). The obtained compound is a gum. It was triturated with 2 ml of EtOAc, formed a nice solid, it was filtered, washed with Et2O and dried to give 230 mg of white solid. 1H NMR showed slight shift of couple of peaks, it may be due to the protonation. 63 mg of this compound registered and submitted (EN02868-04-2).  Third setup fractions showed no required product peaks, was discarded.  EN02868-04-1, the remaining material after submission (EN02868-04-2), the filtrate of EN02868-04-2 combined, concentrated, treated with 3 g of MP- carbonate in THF (30 ml). After 1 h stirring, it was filtered washed with THF, concentrated, triturated with CH3CN, filtered and dried to give white color solid (EN02868-04-3).  Conclusion: Product isolated  "}
